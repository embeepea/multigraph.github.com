Downloading Multigraph
======================

Note that you do not actually need to download Multigraph in order to use it; you can use Multigraph
in any web page by including something like the following in the 
<tt><span class="nt">&lt;head&gt;</span></tt> of your HTML page:

{% highlight html %}
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://multigraph.github.com/download/multigraph-min.js"></script>
{% endhighlight %}

If you want to download your own copy, however, you can do so here:

{% include release-table.html %}

Note that the latest version is always available as multigraph.js and multigraph-min.js; these files
are simply copies of the most recent similarly named files with version numbers.
