Downloading (HTML5) Multigraph
==============================

Note that you do not actually need to download Multigraph in order to use it; you can use Multigraph
in any web page by including something like the following in the 
<tt><span class="nt">&lt;head&gt;</span></tt> of your HTML page:

{% highlight html %}
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://multigraph.github.io/download/multigraph-min.js"></script>
{% endhighlight %}

If you want to download your own copy, however, you can do so here:

{% include release-table.html %}

Note that the latest version appears twice in the above table --- on the first
row as <code>multigraph.js</code> /
<code>multigraph-min.js</code>, and then again on the second row with filenames
that include the version number.  These files are duplicates of each
other; the version-numberless copies are simply for convenience, so
that the URLs
[http://multigraph.github.io/download/multigraph.js](http://multigraph.github.io/download/multigraph.js)
and
[http://multigraph.github.io/download/multigraph-min.js](http://multigraph.github.io/download/multigraph-min.js)
always point to the most recent version.

Older (pre-HTML5) Versions
==========================

Prior to the HTML5 version (i.e. prior to version 4.0), Multigraph was an Adobe Flash
application.  The Flash version of Multigraph was/is used in much the
same way as the current HTML5/JavaScript.  The original
[www.multigraph.org](http://www.multigraph.org) web site explains how
to use the Flash version, and you can download all versions of it from
[multigraph.github.io/archive](http://multigraph.github.io/archive).

Source Code / Development
=========================

Multigraph development takes place on Github: [github.com/multigraph/js-multigraph](http://github.com/multigraph/js-multigraph)

Development of the older Flash version is also on Github:
[github.com/multigraph/flash-multigraph](http://github.com/multigraph/flash-multigraph)
