      <h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
Multigraph is a program for creating 2-dimensional scientific data
graphs in web pages. It can read data in a variety of formats, and
allows you to customize the appearance of the graph to your
liking.  Multigraph provides interactive "pan" and "zoom" capabilities,
giving the viewer the ability to change the horizontal and/or vertical
scales in the graph on the fly. Multigraph also has the ability to
read data from a web service, which allows it to be used to "surf"
through large datasets, downloading only those the parts of the data
that are needed for display.
</p>

<p>
Multigraph is written in pure JavaScript and will work in any reasonably
modern web browser, including on mobile devices.
</p>

<p>

Multigraph was inspired by interactive mapping sites such as Google Maps;
just as you can use Google Maps to pan and zoom around a geographic
area, in order to see some particular feature or relationship,
Multigraph lets you pan or zoom around in "data space" in order to better
understand and visualize the data.

</p>

<h2>Interacting with a Multigraph</h2>

<p>
Here's an example of a Multigraph:
</p>

<center>
<div class="multigraph" data-width="1000" data-height="200" data-src="lib/js-multigraph/spec/mugl/acis-static.xml"></div>
</center>

<p>
This graph shows daily temperature data from a weather
station near Asheville, NC.  The blue bars represent the daily high and low
temperatures -- the bottom of the bar is the low for the day, and the top
of the bar is the high.  The green band in the background shows the official
"normal" temperature range for this location.  By looking at the actual
daily data on top of the normal range, it's easy to see whether weather
during any given period was hotter or colder than normal.
</p>

<h3>Panning</h3>

<p>
The initial time period displayed in the graph above is the year 2012.
If you want to see what happened before Jan 1 2012, just click and
drag with your mouse (or finger, if you're using a touch-screen device)
to drag the graph to the right.  You can also drag the graph
vertically to change the temperature scale.
</p>

<p>
Multigraph's panning behavior is slightly different from what happens
when you pan around in an interactive map, in that it always moves in
either a purely horizontal or a purely vertical orientation; you cannot
pan in a way that affects the vertical and horizontal at the same
time.  Whenever you start a new drag motion, Multigraph notices which
orientation -- horizontal or vertical -- your first motion is closest
to, and locks the motion to that orientation until you release the
mouse or your finger.
</p>

<h3>Zooming</h3>

<p>
You can also zoom in or out in the graph, by pointing the mouse cursor
near an axis and rolling the mouse wheel.  If you're using a
touch-screen device, you can zoom by doing a two-finger pinch gesture.
</p>

<p>
An alternate way of zooming is to point the mouse cursor near an axis,
hold down the shift key on the keyboard, and then (while continuing to
hold down the shift key), click and drag the mouse.
</p>


<h2>Creating a Multigraph</h2>

<p>
To create an interactive graph of your own and publish it to a web site,
you first
write an XML file that describes the details of the graph.  This XML
file, in a format known as MUGL (for MUltiGraph xmL), includes things
like plot styles, colors, axis dimensions, as well as the data to be
plotted.  You then put a line like the following in the
<tt><span class="nt">&lt;head&gt;</span></tt> of your HTML document:
</p>

<blockquote>
<tt><span class="nt">&lt;script </span><span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">&quot;text/javascript&quot;</span> <span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">&quot;https://raw.github.com/multigraph/js-multigraph/master/build/multigraph-min.js&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span><span class="nt">&lt;/script&gt;</span></tt>
</blockquote>

<p>
and a line like the following at the place in your document where you'd
like the graph to appear:
</p>

<blockquote>
<tt><span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">&quot;multigraph&quot;</span> <span class="na">data-src=</span><span class="s">&quot;file.mugl&quot;</span> <span class="na">data-width=</span><span class="s">&quot;500&quot;</span> <span class="na">data-height=</span><span class="s">&quot;400&quot;</span><span class="nt">/&gt;</span><span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span></tt>
</blockquote>

<p>
That's all there is to it.  If you want, you can specify the width and
height of the graph using CSS rules instead of using
the <tt><span class="na">data-width</span></tt>
and <tt><span class="na">data-height</span></tt> attributes, and it's
also possible to create and manipulate graphs using JavaScript code
instead of the above HTML markup; see
the <a href="documentation.html">documentation</a> for details.
</p>

<p>
You can see lots of examples of graphs, and the MUGL files that
generate them, in the <a href="examples">Examples</a> section of this web site.
