MUGL Schema XSD 
===============

The following XSD document defines the MUGL file specification.  The
copy of the XSD on this page is always automatically updated to match
the version used by the latest release of Multigraph.  In addition to
viewing the syntax-highlighted copy of the XSD below, you can download
the file here: [mugl.xsd](mugl.xsd).

Note that an [annotated MUGL file](annotated-mugl), which shows valid MUGL
syntax with comments documenting every possible element and attribute
value, is also available.

{% highlight xml %}
{% include mugl.xsd %}
{% endhighlight %}
