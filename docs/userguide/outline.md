MUGL by Example (?)
    <sequence of examples, starting simple and progressing to more compilicated>
    
    Don't write this as part of the manual; think about doing this
    in the examples section --- rework the examples so that they
    are a nice progressie series, perhaps with explanatory text
    associated with each one.
