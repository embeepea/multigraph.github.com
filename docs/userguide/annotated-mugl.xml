        |   visible: whether the legend should be drawn or not; the default is "false"

        |       than one plot

        |       background to be drawn behind the legend.  This opacity value only
        |       affects the legend background; it does not affect the text or icons
        |       inside the legend
        |   border: thickness, in pixels, of the border drawn around the legend; a
        |       value of 0 causes no border to be drawn

        |   rows, columns: the legend is layed out in a grid, with an icon and text
        |       label corresponding to a single plot in each grid cell.  These attributes
        |       determine how many rows and/or columns are in the grid.
        |       If neither rows nor columns is specified, columns defaults to 1,
        |       and there will be one row for each plots

        |       will be computed to be whatever it needs to be so that rows X columns
        |       is greater than or equal to the number of plots.  If both rows and columns
        |       are specified, the legend is layed out in a grid of that size.

        | the default values is implied.
        |
        | id: the id of the axis.  If this attribute is missing, an id of "x" is used for
        |     the first horizontal axis, "x1" for the second, and so on.
        | type: the data type of the axis
        | length: the length of the axis, as a DISPLACEMENT, where A is a number between 0
        |     and 1 representing a fraction of the width of the plot area, and B is a number
        |     of pixels to be added to that length
        | base: a POINT in the range (-1,-1) to (1,1) giving the location in the plot area
        |     of the base point for the axis's location
        | position: a POINT value giving the position offset for the location of the axis,
        |     relative to the base point
        | anchor: a single number in the range [-1,1] indicating the location of the
        |     anchor point along the axis.  -1 corresponds to the left endpoint, and 1
        |     corresponds to the right endpoint.
        | min: the minimum data value for the axis; this is typically the value associated
        |     with the left endpoint of the axis, but see "minposition" below.
        | max: the maximum data value for the axis; this is typically the value associated
        |     with the right endpoint of the axis, but see "maxposition" below.
        | minposition: the location on the axis that corresponds to the minimum data value;
        |     this is a DISPLACEMENT value, in which A is number in the range [-1,1], with -1
        |     corresponding to the left endpoint, and 1 corresponding to the right endpoint.
        |     The value B is a pixel offset from the location determined by A.  The default
        |     value of minposition is "-1", which corresponds to the left endpoint of the axis.
        | maxposition: the location on the axis that corresponds to the maximum data value;
        |     this is a DISPLACEMENT value, in which A is number in the range [-1,1], with -1
        |     corresponding to the left endpoint, and 1 corresponding to the right endpoint.
